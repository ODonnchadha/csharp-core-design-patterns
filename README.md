## C# 10 Design Patterns by Kevin Dockx
- This course will teach you how to improve code base by using tested and proven object-oriented design patterns.

- COURSE OVERVIEW:
  - Real-life examples. Use cases and associated consequences. And related patterns.

- INTRODUCTION TO DESIGN PATTERNS:
  - .NET 6.0 & C# 10. Visual Studio 2022. Prerequisites, frameworks, & tooling. GO4.
  - All 23 GO4 patterns are covered. Intent. Structure. Implementation.
  - The pattern internt should remain the same, regardless of surrounding implementation. Know what opportunity the pattern does resolve.
  - Creational:
    - Five patterns dealing with object creation.
      - Abstracting the object instantiation process.
      - Making the system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.
  - Structural:
    - Seven patterns defining the relations between classes.
      - Concerned with how classes & objects are composed to form larger structures.
  - Behavioral:
    - Eleven patterns dealing with ways to communicate between classes or objects.
      - Characterize complex control flow that's difficult to follow at runtime. Concentrate on how objects are interconnected.
  - Object-oriented principles:
    - Program to an interfaces and not an implementation.
      - This allows for loose coupling.
      - Clients remain unaware of the specific types of objects they use as long as the objects adhere to the interface expected.
      - Client remain unaware of the classes that implement these objects. Clients only know about the interface.
      - Interface vs abstract class:
        - Use an abstract base class when you need to provide some basic functionality that can potentially be overridden.
        - Use an interface when you only need to specify the expected functionality of a class.
      - Commonly correlates to adhering to the open/closed principle. SOLID.
        - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
    - Favor object composition over class inheritance.
      - CLass inheritance. Lets you define the implementation of one class in terms of another.
      - Object composition: New functionality is obtained by assembling or composing objects to get more complex functionality.
      - Inheritance tends to be overused. Composition often simplifies desgins and makes them more reuseable.
      - And commonly correlates to adhering to the single responsibility principle SOLID.
        - A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
  - Summary:
    - A design pattern is a general, reuseable solution to a commonly occuring problem within a given context in software design.
    - Creational patterns help with making your system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.
    - Structural patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.
    - Behavorial patterns characterize complex control flow that's difficult to follow at runtime, and let you concentrate on the way objects are interconnected.
